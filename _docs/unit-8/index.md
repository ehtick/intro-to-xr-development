# Project

## Introduction

Throughout this curriculum, you've learned a range of concepts related to XR development. While this curriculum is the just the beginning of becoming familiar with XR development, the concepts you've learned will carry over onto more complex app development. This capstone project serves as an opportunity to demonstrate what you've learned over the course of the past 7 units. For your capstone project, develop an XR application to be deployed to your XR device of choice. You could either transform the basketball game app created in this curriculum or create a new project.

You are encouraged to explore concepts not covered in this curriculum to aid in creating your project.

### Expectations

- Plan an approach that follows the workflow introduced in the curriculum: Design, Prototype, Develop, Deploy.
- Create or import assets such as models or materials. Royalty-free 3D models and textures are available at [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/), [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/), and [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/).
- Create the application in Unity.
- Create a 2-page written rationale that includes the following:
  - The app's intended audience.
  - An explanation for your device decision.
  - An explanation of your development workflow.
  - A story board of the app.
  - Design & environmental considerations that influenced your development decisions.
  - Scripts documented to explain app logic.
